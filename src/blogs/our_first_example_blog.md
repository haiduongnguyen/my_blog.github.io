# First Post: Intro my self

## Personal
My name is Nguyen Hai Duong. I was born in Hai Duong, too :-)      
I am the last gen of 9x, which is a 'golden generation'.   
I am 1m70 and 62 kg, and this is my face ...

This is all basic information about me that I want you to know 😁😁. 

## Carrer
I study at Ha Noi University of Science and Technology. My major is Electrics and Telecommunication but I don't follow this field. Instead I enjoy IT more, I myself dive in IT, and now I am working as Fresher Data Enginner at FTP Software.
